A small custom JSON or DZE file for a small role play mission on DayZ servers. 

The idea is that a small detachment of communications soldiers have crossed the Chernarus boarder and setup radio communications at the radio tower located at coordinates: 306.23 / 2704.57. 

Possible reasons are reconasence or advanced party, to set up coms for for a larger force.  

This can be turned on and staffed by a few players with weapons of choice.  Continuing with the same idea it is recommended that advanced party communications specialist soldiers use weapons that make it hard to shoot at distance, but it would be unlikely to have high tier sniper weapons.  We would recommend providing red armbands and red berets with some uniform of choice to the make it easy to identify the soldiers.

As it's a very open area, some cover items have been included at the top of the hill.  You could set fence kits up along southern approach to channel the in preferred direction and to slow the enemy advacnce.  It is recommened to install the post only and then string barbwire across the bottom, forcing advancing soliders to go around or to go through and receive cuts.  At the same time not providing coverage or concelment.
